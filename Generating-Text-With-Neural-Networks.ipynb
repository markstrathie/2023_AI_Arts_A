    "\n",
    "Framing a problem involves defining the ideal outcome, identifying the model's output, and defining success metrics. This is important to ensure we even need to use ML in the first place. It then defines how we carry out the rest of the steps along the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, given a sequence of characters from a dataset of Shakespeare's scripts, we want to train a model to predict the next character in the sequence. Longer sequences of text can then be generated by calling the model repeatedly. More speficially, we need the output to be in English, formatted correctly with correct grammer and punctuation. Success can easily be measured by reading the output in comparison to Shakespeare's real scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a normal machine learning problem, various model types would be considered each with their own advantages and disadvantages. However, in this notebook we have already chosen to use a <b>Neural Network</b>. This is because it is well-suited to work with nonlinear data with large number of inputs, such as our scripts.\n",

    "- Input Layer: receives the initial data and passes them to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hidden Layers: intermediary layers that consist of multiple neurons that perform computations on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output Layer: the final layer that produces the network's output based on the information processed through the hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are trained using a process called supervised learning, where they learn from labeled training data. The learning involves adjusting the weights associated with each connection between neurons to minimise the difference between predicted outputs and actual target values. This optimisation process enables the network to make predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of neural networks exist, but we will only use a <b>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</b>. These are designed to handle sequential data by incorporating feedback loops, making them suitable for tasks like natural language processing - perfect for our text generation!\n",
    "\n",
    "To acheive our goal we will be using <b>TensorFlow</b> which is a machine learning framework developed by Google Brain. It allows us to more easily develop, train, and deploy machine learning models, particularly neural networks.
